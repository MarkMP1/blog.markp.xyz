Hello! My name is Mark Peng. <br /><br />
I am currently a junior in highschool, who is currently deeply interested in computer science and rhythm gaming. When I am working on something computer science related, expirementing around with personal projects and coding challenges, I often undergo many experiences worth telling stories for,but often with no one to tell them to. I used to tell these stories in group chats with friends, however as my diction and stories grew increasingly more technical, my friends were no longer able to keep up with my tales. And as a result, this blog was created!

Over the course of my life, I have learned that one of the ways I learn best is by teaching it. However, when it comes to computer science, I rarely have any friends or peers who are available or are in need to learn various computer science concepts. This blog is a perfect opportunity for me to express my interest and strengthen my knowledge in computer science, and many blog posts will likely be dedicated to various CS concepts I am interested in and currently learning about. My interests in CS mostly reside in back-end development and competitive programming. Currently, I mostly spend my time working on improving on my competitive programming skills. I do competitive programming mainly on [DMOJ][dmoj] and [Codeforces][codeforces]. Most (probably all) of my competitive programming related blogs will use code written in C++.

Outside of computer science, I also really enjoy playing rhythm games! I have played a large variety of rhythm games, ranging from osu!standard all the way to Arcaea. Outside of the rhythm game genre, I also enjoy an assortment of games ranging from Terraria to VALORANT. If you want a quick game recommendation from me, make sure to check out Hollow Knight from Team Cherry. 

<sub><sup>*Make sure to beat Hollow Knight quickly, before the sequel Silksong is released, though I doubt that's coming out any time soon.*</sup></sub>

That's all I have to say. I hope you enjoyed your read :)
